DESCRIPTION				  *ShowTrailingWhitespace-description*

This plugin highlights whitespace at the end of each line (except when typing
at the end of a line). It uses the matchadd()-function, therefore doesn't
interfere with syntax highlighting and leaves the |:match| command for other
uses.
Highlighting can be switched on/off globally and for individual buffers. The
plugin comes with exceptions for certain filetypes, where certain lines can /
must include trailing whitespace; additional patterns can be configured.

SEE ALSO								     *

Many plugins also come with a command to strip off the trailing whitespace;
this plugin separates this into the companion |DeleteTrailingWhitespace.vim|
plugin (vimscript #3967), which can even remove the trailing whitespace
automatically on each write.

To quickly locate the occurrences of trailing whitespace, you can use the
companion |JumpToTrailingWhitespace.vim| plugin (vimscript #3968).

RELATED WORKS								     *

There are already a number of plugins for this purpose, most based on this
VimTip:
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Highlight_unwanted_spaces
However, most of them use the older :match command and are not as flexible.
- smartmatcheol.vim (vimscript #2635) highlights based on file extension or
  name.
- trailing-whitespace (vimscript #3201) uses :match.
- bad-whitespace (vimscript #3735) uses :match, allows on/off/toggling via
  commands.
- Trailer Trash (vimscript #3938) uses :match.
- DynamicSigns (vimscript #3965) can show whitespace errors (also mixed
  indent) in the sign column.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*ShowTrailingWhitespace-usage*

By default, trailing whitespace is highlighted in all Vim buffers. Some users
may want to selectively enable / disable this for certain filetypes, or files
in a particular directory hierarchy, or toggle this on demand. Since it's
difficult to accommodate all these demands with short and easy mappings and
commands, this plugin does not define any of them, and leaves it to you to
tailor the plugin to your needs. See |ShowTrailingWhitespace-configuration|
below.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				 *ShowTrailingWhitespace-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim ShowTrailingWhitespace*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				 *ShowTrailingWhitespace-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.1 with "matchadd()", or Vim 7.2 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				*ShowTrailingWhitespace-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

					       *ShowTrailingWhitespace-colors*
To change the highlighting colors: >
    highlight ShowTrailingWhitespace ctermbg=Red guibg=Red
<
						    *g:ShowTrailingWhitespace*
By default, highlighting is enabled for all buffers, and you can (selectively)
disable it. To work from the opposite premise, launch Vim with highlighting
disabled: >
    let g:ShowTrailingWhitespace = 0
<
					 *g:ShowTrailingWhitespace_FilterFunc*
In addition to toggling the highlighting on/off via
|g:ShowTrailingWhitespace|, the decision can also be influenced by buffer
settings or the environment. By default, buffers that are not persisted to
disk (unless they are scratch buffers) or not modifiable (like user interface
windows from various plugins) are skipped. You can disable this filtering: >
    let g:ShowTrailingWhitespace_FilterFunc = ''
or install your own custom filter function instead: >
    let g:ShowTrailingWhitespace_FilterFunc = function('MyFunc')
<

					     *ShowTrailingWhitespace-commands*
Highlighting can be enabled / disabled globally and for individual buffers.
Analog to the |:set| and |:setlocal| commands, you can define the following
commands: >
    command! -bar ShowTrailingWhitespaceOn          call ShowTrailingWhitespace#Set(1,1)
    command! -bar ShowTrailingWhitespaceOff         call ShowTrailingWhitespace#Set(0,1)
    command! -bar ShowTrailingWhitespaceBufferOn    call ShowTrailingWhitespace#Set(1,0)
    command! -bar ShowTrailingWhitespaceBufferOff   call ShowTrailingWhitespace#Set(0,0)
To set the local highlighting back to its global value (like :set {option}<
does), the following command can be defined: >
    command! -bar ShowTrailingWhitespaceBufferClear call ShowTrailingWhitespace#Reset()
<
					     *ShowTrailingWhitespace-mappings*
You can also define a quick mapping to toggle the highlighting (here, locally;
for global toggling use ShowTrailingWhitespace#Toggle(1): >
    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>t$ :<C-u>call ShowTrailingWhitespace#Toggle(0)<Bar>echo (ShowTrailingWhitespace#IsSet() ? 'Show trailing whitespace' : 'Not showing trailing whitespace')<CR>
<
					   *ShowTrailingWhitespace-exceptions*
For some filetypes, in certain places, trailing whitespace is part of the
syntax or even mandatory. If you don't want to be bothered by these showing up
as false positives, you can augment the regular expression so that these
places do not match. The ShowTrailingWhitespace#SetLocalExtraPattern()
function takes a regular expression that is prepended to the pattern for the
trailing whitespace. For a certain filetype, this is best set in a file
    ftplugin/{filetype}_ShowTrailingWhitespace.vim


==============================================================================
INTEGRATION				  *ShowTrailingWhitespace-integration*
					    *ShowTrailingWhitespace-functions*
The ShowTrailingWhitespace#IsSet() function can be used to query the on/off
status for the current buffer, e.g. for use in the |statusline|.

To obtain the pattern for matching trailing whitespace, including any
|ShowTrailingWhitespace-exceptions|, you can use the function
ShowTrailingWhitespace#Pattern(0).
